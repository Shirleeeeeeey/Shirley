		<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
	<p>&nbsp The area of psychology concerned with learning has produced a rather well-defined body of literature explaining the process underlying how animals and humans learn. Some of the most famous names in the history of psychology have made their most influential discoveries in this field--names that are easily recognized by those both inside and outside the behavioral sciences, such as Pavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Bandura. Picking a few of the most significant studies from this branch of psychology and from these researchers is no easy task, but the articles selected here can be found in nearly every introductory psychology textbook and are representative of the enormous contributions of these scientists.</p><br>		
	<p>&nbsp For Ivan Pavlov, we take a journey back to the early 1900s to review his work with dogs, metronomes, bells, salivation, and the discovery of the conditioned reflex. Second, John Watson, known for many contributions, is probably most famous (notorious?) for his 1920 ethically challenged experiment with Little Albert, which demonstrated for the first time how emotions could be shown to be a product of the environment rather than purely internal processes. For the third study in this section, we discuss B. F. Skinner's famous demonstration of superstitious behavior in a pigeon and his explanation for how humans become superstitious in exacdy the same way. Fourth, we examine the well-known "Bobo Doll Study," in which Albert Bandura established that aggressive behaviors could be learned by children through their modeling of adult violence.</p>
