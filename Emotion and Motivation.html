		<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
	<p>&nbsp This section deals with our inner experiences of emotion and motivation. Many nonpsychologists have trouble with the idea of researching these issues scientifically. A popular belief contends that our emotions and motivations just happen,that we don't have much control over them, and that they are part of our standard equipment from birth. However, psychologists have always been fascinated with the issues of where your emotions come from and how your feelings cause you to act as you do. Emotion and motivation are basic and powerful influences on behavior, and a great deal of research allows us to understand them better.</p><br>		
	<p>&nbsp The first study in this section may surprise you in that it focuses on the sexual response studies begun by the famous research team of Masters and Johnson in the 1960s. It is included here because human sexual feelings and behaviors are strongly influenced by our emotions, which can also serve as powerful motivational forces. The second reading examines a famous and fascinating study about facial expressions of emotions and demonstrates that our facial expressions for basic emotions are the same for everyone in all cultures throughout the world. The third study in this section presents research about how extreme emotions, those that create stress, can affect your health. The fourth reading allows you to experience the process of one of the most, if not the most, famous experiments in the area of motivation: the original demonstration of a psychological event called cognitive dissonance.</p>
