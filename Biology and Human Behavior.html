	<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
	<p>&nbsp Nearly all general psychology texts begin with chapters relating to the biology of 11 human behavior. This is due not simply to convention but rather because basic biological processes underlie all behavior. The various branches of psychol- ogy rest, to varying degrees, on this biological foundation. The area ofpsychology that studies these biological functions is typically called psychobiology or biological psychology. This field focuses on the actions of your brain and nervous system; the processes of receiving stimulation and information from the environment through your senses; the ways your brain organizes sensory information to create your perceptions of the world; and how all of this affects your body and behavior.</p><br>
	<p>&nbsp The studies chosen to represent this basic component of psychological research include a wide range of research and are among the most influential and most often cited. The first study discusses a famous research program on right-brain/left-brain specialization that shaped much of our present knowl- edge about how the brain functions. Next is a study that surprised the scien- tific community by demonstrating how a stimulating "childhood" might result in a more highly developed brain. The third study represents a fundamental change in the thinking of many psychologists about the basic causes of human behavior, personality, and social interactionâ€”namely, a new appreciation for the significance of your genes. Fourth is the invention of the famous visual cliff method of studying infants' abilities to perceive depth. All these studies, along with several others in this book, also address an issue that underlies and con- nects nearly all areas of psychology and provides the fuel for an ongoing and fascinating debate: the nature-nurture controversy.</p><br><hr><br>
	<h2>Reading 1: ONE BRAIN OR TWO?</h2>
	<h4>Gazzaniga, M. S. (1967). The split brain in man. Scientific American, 217(2), 24-29.</h4><br>
	<p>&nbsp You are probably aware that the two halves ofyour brain are not the same and that they perform different functions. For example, in general the left side of your brain is responsible for movement in the right side ofyour body, and viceversa. Beyond this, though, the two brain hemispheres appear to have much greater specialized abilities.</p><br>
	<p>&nbsp It has come to be rather common knowledge that, for most ofus, the left brain controls our ability to use language while the right is involved in spatial relationships, such as those needed for artistic activities. Stroke or head-injury patients who suffer damage to the left side of the brain will usually lose, to varying degrees, their ability to speak (often this skill returns with therapy and training). Many people believe that each half, or hemisphere, of your brain may actually be a completely separate mental system with its own individual abilities for learning, remembering, perceiving the world, and feeling emotions. The concepts underlying this view of the brain rest on early scientific research on the effects of splitting the brain into two separate hemispheres.</p><br>
	<p>&nbsp That research was pioneered by Roger W. Sperry (1913-1994), beginning about 15 years prior to the article examined in this chapter. In his early work with animal subjects, Sperry made many remarkable discoveries. For example, in one series of studies, cats' brains were surgically altered to sever the connection between the two halves of the brain and to alter the optic nerves so that the left eye transmitted information only to the left hemisphere and the right eye only to the right hemisphere. Following surgery, the cats appeared to behave normally and exhibited virtually no ill effects. Then, with the right eye covered, the cats learned a new behavior, such as walking through a short maze to find food. After the cats became skilled at maneuvering through the maze, the eye cover was shifted to the cats' left eyes. Now, when the cats were placed back in the maze, their right brains had no idea where to turn and the animals had to relearn the entire maze from the beginning.</p><br>
	<p>&nbsp Sperry conducted many related studies over the next 30 years, and in 1981 he received the Nobel Prize for his work on the specialized abilities of the two hemispheres of the brain. When his research endeavors turned to human participants in the early 1960s, he was joined in his work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) by Michael Gazzaniga. Although Sperry is considered to be the founder of split-brain research, Gazzaniga's article has been chosen here because it is a clear, concise summary of their early collaborative work with human participants and it, along with other related research by Gazzaniga, is cited often in psychology texts. Its selection is in no way intended to overlook or overshadow either Sperry's leadership in this field or his great contributions. Gazzaniga, in large part, owes his early research, and his discoveries in the area of hemispheric specialization, to Roger W. Sperry (see Sperry, 1968; Puente, 1995).</p><br>
	<p>&nbsp To understand split-brain research, some knowledge of human physiol- ogy is required. The two hemispheres ofyour brain are in constant communication with one another via the corpus callosum, a structure made up of about 200 million nerve fibers. Ifyour corpus callosum is cut, this major line ofcommunication is disrupted, and the two halves ofyour brain must then function independently. If we want to study each half of your brain separately, all we need to do is surgically sever your corpus callosum.</p><br>
	<p>&nbsp But can scientists surgically divide the brains of humans for research purposes? That sounds more like a Frankenstein movie than real science! Ob- viously, research ethics would never allow such drastic methods simply for the purpose of studying the specialized abilities of the brain's two hemispheres. However, in the late 1950s, the field of medicine provided psychologists with a golden opportunity. In some people with very rare and very extreme cases of uncontrollable epilepsy, seizures could be greatly reduced or virtually elimi- nated by surgically severing the corpus callosum. This operation was (and is) successful, as a last resort, for those patients who cannot be helped by any other means. When this article was written in 1966, 10 such operations had been undertaken, and four of the patients consented to participate in exami- nation and testing by Sperry and Gazzaniga to determine how their percep- tual and intellectual skills were affected by this surgical treatment.</p>
